## General info
I have created this "Taxi service" project to demonstrate my expertise in Java Core, Object-oriented programming, SOLID concepts, JDBC and WEB-technology.
In this web-application we can registrate or authenticate a driver, create new car or manufacturer that will be added to the DB. Moreover, in this app you 
can add driver to a car and look at the list of all cars that our driver use.

# ‚ùì How to use it:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Crate new driver - it's you account (login and password).

2Ô∏è‚É£ Login.

3Ô∏è‚É£ You can 
- create new car, manufacturer, add manufacturer to car, driver to car, 
- look all drivers, cars and others,
- also you can delete some information
